            <p>When they were young lads, Isaiah and Justin dreamed of driving and exploring the world. However, there was one major problem: wee little lads can't drive in the United States.</p>
            
            <p>"Why can't I go to Tommy's birthday party, Mom?" Justin once asked.</p>
            
            <p>"Because you can't drive, and I don't want to take you," she replied.</p>
            
            <p>Those words stung, and Justin never forgot them. It wasn't until he met Isaiah and they both took ORF 401 at Princeton that everything started to make sense. A wise mentor advised them to create a business that would help people get where they wanted to go—whether or not they owned a car.</p>
            
            <p>And so, Ryde was born.</p>
            
            <p>At RYDE©, we value comfort, convenience, and experience. If you need a ride, we'll seamlessly and effortlessly get you where you need to go.</p>
